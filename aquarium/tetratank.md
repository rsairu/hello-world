## Diet

**FEEDING TIP**: (Father Fish) *A hungry fish is a healthy fish*. Common metric is eye is about size of stomach; little amount of food, what they can eat in 2-3 minutes (1 minute if few fish). If they don't have a clear appetite during feedings, they are overfed; reduce volume or frequency.

*Breakfast only when young. Stopped after fish were about 2 months after got from pet store*  
7-10 AM PST; Flakes
 
**Dinner**  
6-9 PM PST, 5-6 days/week
* Flakes + bloodworm (freeze dried)  
* Crushed alga wafer for herbivores (infrequent, as supplement for/variety from tank algae)

**Snacks**  
Infrequent
* Crushed shrimp food (omnivore pellet) (mineralization)  
* Blanched zucchini

## Habitat 


### Photonic schehdule


![](photonic.png)  
*(Fluval AqauSky LED app) As you can see from the schedule, the fish and plants have a clear diurnal schedule*

### Tidal schedule

*TBD*

### Water and substrate

* Temp: 76°F / 24.4°C
* Tap pH (6-8). Water conditioned with cholorine removal only
* No artificial / supplemental filtration beyond coarse and fine mechanical
* Bare bottom water column at tech end (wave maker / heater / filter intake). Makes refilling super easy, also serves as feeding area.
* 1 inch white sand substrate over washed soil. Some rocks in back to create subterranean space in 3 inches of soil. Heavier planting in the back for fish comfort (garden/forest end). Natural algae not removed from here for algaevores / undisturbed habitat.

## Tech

| ITEM | COST |
| [Hygger Eco slim wave maker](https://github.com/rsairu/howto/blob/main/hygger_eco_slim.md) | $ XXX.XX |
| [Fluval Aquaclear filter](https://github.com/rsairu/howto/blob/main/fluval_aquaclear_powerfilter.md) | ¥ XXXXX.XX |
| Fluval Aquasky LED |  ₽ XXXXX.XX |
| [Orlushy heater](https://github.com/rsairu/howto/blob/main/orlushy_heater.md) | here, too |

## Maintenance Costs

| | |
| Electricity per month | $2.58/month (room temp @ 71F, tank @ 75F) |
| Feed per month | ? |

## Upkeep

Every task here takes about 30-45 minute. So if you do more at once, that would be total service time

|||
| --- | --- |
|Water change |~ one-two times a month, 33% (create a syphon and kick up dust with an eyedropper, pick a small area to work in)  
|Aquascape| Usually done a little with water change, as water is low (trim, cut, remove, plant)
|Service filter/filter media| ~ once a month, as necessary
|Service impeller (of the filter)| ~ 4-5 year, clean impeller  
|Service wave maker|As necessary, to clear error or brush algae
